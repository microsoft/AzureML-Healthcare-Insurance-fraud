        "Fraud is defined as any deliberate and dishonest act committed with the knowledge that it could result in an unauthorized benefit to the person committing the act or someone else who is similarly not entitled to the benefit. Healthcare fraud is one of the types of fraud.\n",
        "Here we will analyze and detect “Healthcare Provider Fraud” where the provider fills all the details and makes a claim on behalf of the beneficiary. Provider Fraud is one of the biggest problems that Medicare is facing currently.  Healthcare fraud is an organized crime which involves peers of providers, physicians, beneficiaries acting together to make fraud claims.\n",
        "As per the U.S. legislation, an insurance company should pay a legitimate healthcare claim within 30 days. So, there is very less time to properly investigate this. Insurance companies are the most vulnerable institutions impacted due to these bad practices.  As per the Government, the total Medicare spending increased exponentially due to frauds in Medicare claims. \n",
        "\n",
        "Healthcare fraud and abuse take many forms. Some of the most common types of frauds by providers are:\n",
        "a)\tBilling for services that were not provided.\n",
        "b)\tDuplicate submission of a claim for the same service.\n",
        "c)\tMisrepresenting the service provided.\n",
        "d)\tCharging for a more complex or expensive service than was actually provided.\n",
        "e)\tBilling for a covered service when the service actually provided was not covered."

I have already checked it and I can see there are 506 fraudulent provider(10%) and 4904 non fraudulent providers(90%), which is a highly imbalanced dataset. To mitigate that imbalance I can use either undersampling or oversampling. In a paper discussed above, random undersampling was used because of the very big size of the input data. But here the data size is not big so, I can use random oversampling technique for my case study. (I will try random undersampling as well to check which one is performing best.)\n",

If any of the chronic disease field is missing I will apply domin knowledge to impute it with yes or no. If annual reimbursement or annual deductible amount field is missing I can create a regression model to predict these values.<br>\n",
        "3. From the chronic disease fields of the patient I can calculate the risk score. If the patient has a particular chronic disease it has to be filled with 1 else 0. I can sum up all the columns of chronic disease for a patient to calculate the risk score. Risk score is an important feature in fraud detection. If patient with low risk score is claiming high amount this is suspicious.<br>\n",
